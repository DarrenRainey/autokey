AutoKey PLUS

Read INSTALL for installation instructions.

AutoKey is a desktop automation utility for Linux and X11. It allows the automation of virtually
any task by responding to typed abbreviations and hotkeys. It offers a full-featured GUI that
makes it highly accessible for novices, as well as a scripting interface offering the
full flexibility and power of the Python language.

This software is based upon autokey and has been modified and maintained by me to provide new features and updates to prevents the program from breaking after a system update.
